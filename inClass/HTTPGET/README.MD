## In-Class Practice HTTP GET with ASP.NET MVC Routes and Controllers

1. Create a new ASP.NET MVC Core project called MyWebCalculator
2. Create a new ASP.NET MVC Controller called CalculatorController
3. Create Action Methods for Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Power, Ceiling, and Floor
4. All of the above must be implemented in a separate class library
5. You will reference the DLL only in your MVC project (yay)
6. Create the required parameters for each of the above methods
7. Each method should return a string containing a phrase/sentence indicating the operands given and the result of the operation
8. From a browser, call each method using the appropriate url route and arguments

### Submission of this work includes:

* Pushing this code to github
* Zipping up the solution directory and uploading that to this box.
* Demonstrating that a randomly-selected method works when I visit you to inspect the work.


#### RELEASE VERSION
* Figure out how to change to release version versus debug
