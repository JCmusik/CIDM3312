## In-Class Practice HTTP GET with ASP.NET MVC Routes and Controllers

#### Please write a simple ASP.NET MVC Core application that serves as a unit converter.  Please convert between the following unit types:

* Temperatures - Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin
* Length - Meters, Feet, Yards
* Mass - Ounce, Pound, Gram, Kilogram\

* This will consist of a simple controller.
* You will use an HTML form, expressed in a Razor template, to HTTP POST the data base to the controller.
* Then, when the calculation is complete, we will redirect to show the results in a separate template page.

### Submission of this work includes:

* Push to github and supply the URL for your work.
